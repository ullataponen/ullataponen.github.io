# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio site. It has been strongly inspired by a [team project](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v11-toucans-team-12) done by Evan Kapantais and myself for Voyage #12 in the Chingu community.
You can read more about Chingu Voyages [on Chingu homepage](https://chingu.io/).
